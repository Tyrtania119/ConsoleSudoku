## Known bugs, things to improve

*During game when player inputs numberOfRow <Enter> numberOfCol <Enter> number instead of R|C|N in one line
they can lose track of what was already input
	-> ADD TRACKER TO SHOW PLAYER ROW COL NUMBER SELECTED

*Only one save can be made and loaded
	-> CHANGE SAVING SYSTEM SO PLAYER CAN SAVE MANY FILES

*Folder hierarchy xD
